Problem description:
In this project, a robot was born in a grid-based discrete world. The goal is return moves that can let the robot deliver all the boxes in the world to the drop zone with the <strong>lowest</strong> cost.
The robot is able to pick up any box in a cell that is adjacent (including diagonal) to its standing cell. The robot is able to put down the box to any cell that is adjacent to its standing cell.
The robot can only carry one box. If crashes, the game is over (including crash with walls, or boxes). The cost for moving horizontally or vertically is 2, while it is 3 for moving diagonally. Both the map of the world and the positions of the boxes are given.
