    "The **Proportional** terms is useful for minimizing the error by adjusting the *control variable*, however, as can be seen from the figure, only proportional is not enough to bring the value to to set value if there exists some systematic error. The introduction of **Integral** term is able to account for the systmatic error and bring it to the set value, however, only with the integral term, it takes too long to converge. From the PI without D figure, it can be seen that the algorithm overshoots a lot. The function of **Differential** term is to decrase overshoot."
